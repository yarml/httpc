# httpc
HTTP server in C; Made for learning and fun, nothing serious,
and will have many serious security vulnerabilities.
DO NOT USE.

# WHY???
cuz im bored

# HOW???
`$ mkdir build`

`$ cd build`

`$ cmake ..`

`$ make`

`# ./httpc` will use port 80.

OR

`$ ./httpc [port]`

depending on the port, you may or may not need to run as root.

If any error happens after any command, you're smart enough to figure it out.

# Some docs cuz im nice
The working directory of the executable should have a folder called `server/`
that contains files which will be served to the http client. thas it... for now.

# BTW
this is linux only.
